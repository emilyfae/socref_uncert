	Annote = {Decisional locus models: confidence is computed based on the quality and quantity of evidence in favor of a binary decision.  Firing rates in lateral parietal intraparietal cortex might index the quantity of evidence available for a decision.  Firing rates in OFC in rats also scale with information quantity and discriminate correct and incorrect judgments before the decision has been revealed.

Post-decisional models: But, subjects occasionally change their mind between first-order decision and second order estimation of decision confidence.  So where does confidence come from?  Evidence continues to be collected after the decision is made?

Error monitoring is more about fast tasks where people are pretty sure when they got an answer wrong- there's no uncertainty.

Antisaccade tasks-- ERN correlates with errors (which occur often, but only half are detected) but Pe only correlated with detected erros.

Post-error slowing is observed.  Seem to be correlated exclusively with Pe.},
