@article{Cunningham1989,
	Abstract = {This study investigated the hypothesis that young children have knowledge about their memory that they may be unable to articulate, but are able to reflect on and use in problem-solving. Forty-eight kindergarteners made one of two types of judgments about their memory span for words. Half of the children made prospective verbal predictions about the number of words they thought they could recall from a list of 10. The other half made concurrent, nonverbal predictions by listening to words on a tape and manually stopping the tape when they heard as many words as they thought they could recall. Children's actual recall for words was then assessed. All children participated in multiple trials to assess the effect of task experience on their predictions. Analyses revealed that predictions made in the concurrent task were significantly more accurate than those made in the prospective task. All children lowered their predictions across trials, although only in the concurrent task were children's final-trial predictions not significantly greater than their actual recall. No meaningful effects or interactions were associated with actual recall scores. These results revealed that young children manifested greater memory knowledge when this knowledge was assessed through their concurrent problem-solving behavior rather than through their prospective verbal predictions.},

	Annote = {Decisional locus models: confidence is computed based on the quality and quantity of evidence in favor of a binary decision.  Firing rates in lateral parietal intraparietal cortex might index the quantity of evidence available for a decision.  Firing rates in OFC in rats also scale with information quantity and discriminate correct and incorrect judgments before the decision has been revealed.

Post-decisional models: But, subjects occasionally change their mind between first-order decision and second order estimation of decision confidence.  So where does confidence come from?  Evidence continues to be collected after the decision is made?

Error monitoring is more about fast tasks where people are pretty sure when they got an answer wrong- there's no uncertainty.

Antisaccade tasks-- ERN correlates with errors (which occur often, but only half are detected) but Pe only correlated with detected erros.

Post-error slowing is observed.  Seem to be correlated exclusively with Pe.},
